## About

This is a package containing functions and templates that I like to use.

## How to install

To install the package, use the following code:

``` r
install.packages('inqstools', 
                 repos = c('https://inqs909.r-universe.dev', 
                 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Make sure to install the `remotes` package first.
