```

This article provides a brief introduction on how to build `learnr` tutorials using a custom CSUCI theme. This article is still a work in progress and will have many mistakes. If you find a mistake or bug, please feel free to email me to fix it. Thank you!


To begin, make sure you install and load the `inqstools` package to access the template.

```{r setup}
#remotes::install_github("inqs909/inqstools")
library(inqstools)
```

This will allow you to utilize the `CI_learnr` template to build your interactive tutorial.

To create a template of the CI_learnr RMD file, use the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ci_learnr("NAME_OF_FILE")
```

where you place the name of the new file in the placholder. You do not need to add ".Rmd" to the file. It will automatically do it for you.
